ðŸŽ® Cookie Cats: A/B Test Performance Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard visualizes and analyzes the performance of an A/B test conducted for the mobile game Cookie Cats. The test evaluates player behavior when a feature (a gate) is placed at two different game levels â€” level 30 (control) and level 40 (variant).

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The dashboard helps answer key questions such as:

Does placing a gate at level 40 instead of 30 improve player retention?

Are there differences in player engagement between the two versions?

What is the impact on the number of game rounds played and player progression?

ðŸ’¡ Key Insight
